### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to My repository.

This is an attempt towards making Deep Learning more friendly and approachable. Deep Learning, AI, Machine Learning, CNN may leave some of us puzzled. I have tried to accumulate very fundamental outline of the field, you start with understanding DATA and its importance [here](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/why-data-is-said-to-be-the-backbone-of-artificial-intelligence-bde4e1c209ac) and then jump to run your own Object detection program in Python using TensorFlow. OpenCV plays an important role in image processing and act as mediator between Deep Learning libraries and user, therefore, set of repositories are dedicated only for OpenCV. 

Go through Each Repository and try on your own machine, having GPU is a plus.
